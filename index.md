## Visualizing Software Performance in Immersive Virtual and Augmented Reality

Software systems may exhibit some performances that are inadequate with user requirements. For example, a software that consumes an excessive amount of CPU or memory may appear slow and sluggish, and may be poorly accepted by end-users. 

Effectively identifying the cause and root of poor software performance is known to be a highly difficult and daunting task.
VISIAR is about expanding the state-of-the-art in terms of software performance comprehensions. The hypothesis on which *VISIAR* is based on, is: an immersive and interactive visualization of software performance significantly helps performance engineers to comprehend and address software performance issues. Our previous work indicates that this hypothesis is verifiable. Immersive augmented reality allows users to interact with situated 3D visualizations using the body (e.g., walking, head movements, hand gestures), which can lead to an improved user performance and experience. To expand the state-of-the-art of software performance comprehension, we will adopt two complementary ways: 

- (i) defining new visual supports to assist performance engineers and 
- (ii) exploring new visual mediums in supporting these performance engineering tasks. 

In particular, we will focus on the use of augmented reality as an exploration medium for software performance engineers. As a consequence of the project, we will deliver tools and design methodology to improve performance reliability of software systems.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/visiar-redes/visiar-redes.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
